	// Here I would do the wire up of the service by instantiating the
	// dependencies and injecting them into each layer component.
	// eg:
	//   1. Create the portRepository
	//   2. Create the portSvc and inject the portRepository
	//	 3. Create the Grpc server and inject the portSvc

	// Once the wire up has been complete, the service would be started.
